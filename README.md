## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

As of [DATE], PHP versions 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 are officially deprecated in this repository.

These versions:
- Have reached **End of Life** and no longer receive security updates.
- Are built on **outdated Debian/Alpine base images**.
- May cause unpredictable build failures due to broken dependencies.

**Use PHP 7.4+ or 8.x instead.**

Deprecated Dockerfiles are retained in the [`legacy/`](./legacy/) directory for reference only and will no longer be maintained or published.
